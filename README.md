# The Harley Davidson Landing Page
This repo houses the assets used to build the Harley Davidson website, available at https://olegbiletsky.github.io/Harley-Davidson.

## Languages & Tools
The website is built and developed using the [HTML5](https://medium.com/search?q=html5)  markup language, [CSS3](https://medium.com/search?q=css3) (cascading style sheets), and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) preprocessor scripting language  ([Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world](https://sass-lang.com/)).

For compile/transpile SCSS files to CSS files I used [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Structure
- `/index.html` -  main html file.
- `/css/style.css`  - main file with styles.
- `/css/style.css.map`  - CSS sourcemaps allow the browser to map CSS generated by a pre-processor, such as Sass, back to the original source file, including exactly which Sass mixin, placeholder or variable is responsible for a given line of CSS.
- `/img/`  - project folder with images whose uses at the site.
- `/img/favicon/`  - a small icon that serves as branding for website. I used [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) because creating a favicon should be a simple process :).
- `/img/icons/`  - simple icons for landing.
- `/img/slider/`  - images for gallery slider.
- `/scss/_top-panel.scss`  - section with ad and user's icons.
- `/scss/_header.scss`  - section header.
- `/scss/_hamburger.scss` - hamburger menu for mobile version.
- `/scss/_top-sales.scss` - section top sales.
- `/scss/_products.scss`  - section with products.
- `/scss/_subscribe.scss`  - section subscribe.
- `/scss/_services.scss`  - section services.
- `/scss/_slider.scss`  - gallery slider.
- `/scss/_footer.scss`  - footer section.
- `/scss/styles.scss`  - main SCSS file that included other files.
